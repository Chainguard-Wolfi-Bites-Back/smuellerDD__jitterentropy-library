2.0.1:
 * Invcation of stuck test during initalization

2.0.0:
 * Replace the XOR folding of a time delta with an LFSR -- the use of an
   LFSR is mathematically more sound for the argument to maintain entropy

1.2.0:
 * Use constant time operation of jent_stir_pool to prevent leaking
   timing information about RNG.
 * Make it compile on 32 bit archtectures

1.1.0:
 * start new numbering schema
 * update processing of bit that is deemed holding no entropy by heuristic:
   XOR it into pool without LSFR and bit rotation (reported and suggested
   by Kevin Fowler <kevpfowler@gmail.com>)
